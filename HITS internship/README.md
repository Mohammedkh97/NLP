# README: HITS Internship Projects

## About the Project

During my internship at **HITS Co. for Humanizing Solutions**, I developed innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions focused on extracting and classifying skills from resumes. These projects aimed to enhance recruitment efficiency by leveraging advanced NLP techniques.

## Objectives

1. **Skill Extraction:** Automatically extract relevant skills from candidate resumes using Named Entity Recognition (NER) models.
2. **Resume Classification:** Categorize resumes into appropriate job titles based on extracted skills to streamline hiring processes.

## Technical Implementation

- **NER Model Development:**
  - Built using spaCy v3.5.
  - Leveraged pretrained models to ensure high accuracy in skill extraction.
  - Fine-tuned the model to identify domain-specific entities.

- **Classification System:**
  - Designed a pipeline to match resumes with relevant job titles.
  - Incorporated feature extraction and mapping techniques for precision classification.

- **Data Processing:**
  - Preprocessed large datasets of resumes for training and testing.
  - Ensured consistency and quality of data to improve model performance.

## Key Features

- **Automation:**
  - Automated extraction of key skills, reducing manual effort in resume analysis.

- **Scalability:**
  - Designed the system to handle a large volume of resumes efficiently.

- **Accuracy:**
  - Achieved high accuracy in both skill extraction and classification by leveraging advanced NLP models.
