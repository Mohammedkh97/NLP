# NLP Sentiment Analysis with XGBoost

## Project Overview

This project implements sentiment analysis on product reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It processes a dataset of product reviews, cleans the text data, and uses XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to classify the sentiment of the reviews as positive or negative.

The project includes several key steps, including data preprocessing, text normalization, feature extraction using `CountVectorizer`, and training an XGBoost classifier to predict the sentiment of product reviews.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk`
- `sklearn`
- `xgboost`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Steps Involved

### 1. **Data Loading**
   - The dataset (`Reviews.csv`) contains product reviews and their corresponding ratings.
   - The `rating` column represents the review sentiment, with ratings between 1 and 5.
   
   ```python
   myData = pd.read_csv(r'D:\path\to\your\file\Reviews.csv')
   ```

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Missing Data**: Missing values in the `rating` column are filled with the mode of the column. Rows with missing values in the `text` column are dropped.
   - **Data Balancing**: The `rating` column is transformed to a binary classification problem by grouping ratings 1-3 as negative sentiment (0), and ratings 4-5 as positive sentiment (1).
   
   ```python
   myData.replace(new_ratings , inplace=True)
   ```

### 3. **Text Cleaning**
   - **Removing Stopwords**: The stopwords are filtered to exclude certain words that may impact sentiment, such as 'not', 'don't', etc.
   - **Stemming**: The text is tokenized, and each word is stemmed using the Snowball Stemmer.
   - **Text Normalization**: The text is cleaned and stripped of unwanted characters.

   ```python
   def clean(sent):
       # Clean the text by removing stopwords and applying stemming
       return final_string
   ```

### 4. **Splitting Data**
   - The data is split into training, validation, and test sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
   
   ```python
   train, validate, test = split_data(myData)
   ```

### 5. **Feature Extraction**
   - The `CountVectorizer` is used to convert the text data into a matrix of token counts (with n-grams) to be used by the classifier.

   ```python
   text_processor_0 = Pipeline([('text_vect_0', CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), max_features=16000))])
   ```

### 6. **Model Training**
   - XGBoost is used to train a classifier on the processed text data.

   ```python
   xgboost_classifier = xgboost.XGBClassifier()
   ```

### 7. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and accuracy.
   - A confusion matrix is visualized using a heatmap.

   ```python
   def plot_confusion_matrix(test_labels, target_predicted):
       # Generate and plot the confusion matrix
   ```

---

## Model Evaluation

The evaluation of the model includes:
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the performance.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: To assess the classification quality.
- **ROC Curve and AUC**: To evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes.

```python
def print_metrics(test_labels, target_predicted_binary):
    # Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score
```

---

## Results

The model predicts the sentiment of the reviews and classifies them into two categories:
- Positive (Rating 4-5)
- Negative (Rating 1-3)

A sample output of the classification:

| Review | Sentiment |
|--------|-----------|
| "This product is great!" | Positive |
| "I am disappointed with this item." | Negative |

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of XGBoost in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis. By preprocessing the text data, normalizing it, and applying a strong classifier like XGBoost, we can effectively predict the sentiment of product reviews.
